<h1 id="inf-3203-a1--bitcoin-mining-competition">INF-3203 A1 : Bitcoin Mining Competition</h1>
<h3 id="deadline-on-150224-2359">DEADLINE on 15/02/24 23.59</h3>
<p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has revolutionized
the way we think about money and financial transactions. One of the
key features that sets Bitcoin apart from traditional currency is
its use of a technology called blockchain, which allows for secure
and transparent transactions without the need for a central authority.
At the heart of the Bitcoin system is the concept of Proof of Work,
a computational algorithm that ensures the security and integrity
of the blockchain. In this process, miners compete to solve complex
mathematical problems in order to add new blocks to the blockchain,
and are rewarded with newly created bitcoins for their efforts.
The use of Proof of Work has made Bitcoin one of the most secure
and widely used digital currencies in the world, and has paved
the way for a new era of decentralized finance and innovation.</p>
<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>This assignment entails the task of mining Bitcoin blocks in
accordance with the guidelines of the Proof of Work protocol.
To maintain the focus of this assignment, the use of a p2p
network substrate has been excluded to avoid unnecessary issues.
Instead, each candidate will act as a client, and a server will
be at your disposal for block verification. The process of mining
a block in the Bitcoin blockchain is associated with a reward
in the form of Bitcoin. At the culmination of the competition,
the participant with the highest number of successfully mined
blocks will be recognized as the winner, but be careful of
not melting your GPUs! For this task, you have to work in groups
of 2-3 people.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The following section contains pertinent information regarding
blockchain and Proof of Work. If you are not familiar with
such concepts, please read it thoroughly. A list recommended papers
is listed below [1-6].</p>
<h3 id="blockchains">Blockchains</h3>
<p>A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger of transactions that
is maintained by a network of computers, rather than a central
authority. It is a continuously growing list of blocks, each
containing a timestamp and a cryptographic link to the previous block, forming
a chain of blocks hence the name &quot;blockchain&quot;. Once recorded,
the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively
without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires
consensus of the network majority. Blockchains utilize different
types of consensus mechanisms to reach agreement and validate
transactions across the network. This makes blockchains resistant
to modification and ensures the integrity of the data they contain.</p>
<p>The most well-known consensus
mechanisms are Proof of Work [1] (Bitcoin), Proof of Stake [2-3]
(Ethereum, Avalanche), BFT blockchains [5] (Algorand, Ripple Stellar),
and Proof of Storage [6] (Filecoin).
In a Proof of Work system, miners compete to solve complex
mathematical problems to validate transactions and add new
blocks to the blockchain. Proof of Stake, on the other hand,
instead of miners involves validators being chosen based on
their ownership of the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain.
This reduces the energy consumption and hardware requirements
compared to Proof of Work. In a Byzantine Fault Tolerant
blockchain, nodes in the network must reach a consensus on the
state of the blockchain even in the presence of faulty or
malicious nodes. Such consensus algorithms typically involve
a higher degree of redundancy and communication overhead compared
to Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. Finally, Proof of Storage
requires users to prove that they have stored data reliably and
for a specific amount of time. Each consensus mechanism has its
own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of mechanism can
significantly impact the security, efficiency, and scalability
of the blockchain network.
This assignment is predicated on the largest operational blockchain,
namely Bitcoin, which relies on a consensus mechanism based on the
Proof of Work algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="proof-of-work">Proof of Work</h3>
<p>Proof of Work is the consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin.
The basic idea behind Proof of
Work is to require participants, called miners, to perform a
computationally intensive task in order to create a new block
of transactions on the blockchain. This task is designed to be
difficult, requiring a significant amount of computational power
and energy, in order to ensure that the miner has expended real
resources and has a legitimate interest in maintaining the
integrity of the network. Once a miner has completed the task,
they broadcast the new block to the network, and other nodes on
the network can verify the Proof of Work and add the block to
their own copy of the blockchain. Miners are incentivized to
participate in the process through a reward system, typically
in the form of newly created cryptocurrency that is awarded to
the miner who successfully creates a new block. To elaborate,
a miner's task is to perform double hashing on the block header,
consisting of the previous block hash, timestamp, and Merkle root,
together with a nonce. This process continues until the hash falls
below the specified target, which is also known as difficulty.
The miner increments the nonce until a matching hash is discovered.</p>
<pre><code>+----------------+
|  Block Header  | &lt;--- Previous Block Hash + Timestamp + Merkle Root
+----------------+
        |
        |        +---------------+       +-------------+       +-------------------+
        + ------&gt;|  Double Hash  |------&gt;|  is valid?  |--YES-&gt;|  reward 6.25 BTC  |
        |        +---------------+       +-------------+       +-------------------+
        |                                       |
+----------------+                              |
|     Nonce      |&lt;------------ +1 ------------ NO
+----------------+
</code></pre>
<h3 id="merkle-tree">Merkle Tree</h3>
<p>The security of the Proof of Work lies in the fact that each
new block's hash is computed using a cryptographic function
that incorporates the root of a Merkle tree, which consists
of all the transactions within the block.</p>
<p>In the context of Proof of Work, a Merkle tree is a data
structure used to efficiently summarize all the transactions
(<code>t1, t2, t3, t4</code> in the graph below)
included in a block. In Bitcoin, for example, every block contains
a list of transactions, and in order to perform Proof of Work,
miners must hash the block header along with a nonce value until
a suitable hash is found. Instead of hashing every transaction
in the block individually, which can be time-consuming and
inefficient, a Merkle tree is used to aggregate all the transactions
into a single hash.</p>
<pre><code>          R=h(H1+H2)
         /          \
    H1=h(t1+t2)     H2=h(t3+t4)
    /        \      /        \
  h(t1)    h(t2)  h(t3)     h(t4)
</code></pre>
<p>A Merkle tree works by recursively hashing (<code>h</code> function in
the graph above) pairs of transactions together until a
single hash value is obtained, known as the Merkle
root (<code>R</code> in the graph). The Merkle root is then included in
the block header along with other information such as the timestamp,
nonce, and previous block hash. By including the Merkle root in the
block header, it is possible to prove that a particular transaction
is included in the block without having to include the entire list
of transactions. This is useful for verifying the validity of a
block without having to download and process all the transactions
included in it, which can save time and computing resources.</p>
<p>In summary, the Merkle tree is a key component of the Proof of
Work consensus mechanism because it allows for efficient
verification of the transactions included in a block, which
in turn enables miners to perform Proof of Work more efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>This section offers a comprehensive elucidation of the pre-code
structure, the necessary prerequisites for executing it, and
detailed instructions on how to run it. Additionally, it
includes illustrative examples of runtime instances.</p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>While the code has been developed in <code>Python 3.7.9</code>,
it is expected to be compatible with any subsequent versions
without issues. The <code>requirements.txt</code> file contains a
list of all the necessary packages and libraries required
to execute the code. It is strongly recommended using a
virtual environment when working with this project.
To create a new virtual environment, you can run the following command:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>python -m venv my_venv
</div></code></pre>
<p>After creating the virtual environment, activate it using:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>source my_venv/bin/activate
</div></code></pre>
<p>Once you have activated the virtual environment, you can proceed
to install the required packages by running:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>pip install -r requirements.txt
</div></code></pre>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>The code functions as a simple Client/Server application,
utilizing <code>Flask 2.2.2</code> as a lightweight web application
framework for facilitating Client/Server communication,
while <code>SQLite3</code> serves as a relational database management
system that is employed for the purpose of storing user-related
data. The client is able to establish a connection and communicate
with the server by utilizing pre-defined API endpoints. This allows
the user to perform local block mining, and subsequently submit
the block to the server for verification. Additionally, the API
endpoints provide functionality for retrieving information pertaining
to the current status of the blockchain, user data, and visualization
tools that enable the monitoring of the competition's progression.</p>
<h3 id="pre-code">Pre-code</h3>
<p>Download the pre-code <a href="https://github.com/ted92/bitcoin-mining-competition">here</a>

</div></code></pre>
<p>The <code>src</code> directory contains all the pre-existing code required
for the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>abstractions</code> subdirectory contains data structures that
represent blocks, transactions, and users. These scripts are not
to be altered.</li>
<li>The <code>backbone</code> subdirectory contains scripts related to consensus
and the Merkle tree for transactions. It is the responsibility of
the candidate to <strong>implement the backbone</strong> of the blockchain, which
includes the Proof of Work and the Merkle tree.</li>
<li>The <code>server</code> subdirectory only requires the importation of
constants and Flask calls to the server.</li>
<li>The <code>utils</code> subdirectory contains essential scripts that enable
Client/Server communication, the visualization of users, blocks,
and blockchains, and the cryptographic functions that the <strong>candidate
must utilize</strong> to have their block verified.</li>
<li><code>main.py</code> is the script to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>vis</code> directory stores data that is useful for visualizing
the project's execution at runtime.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>blockchain</code> subdirectory stores a pickle representation
of the blockchain, which the candidate should become familiar with.</li>
<li>The <code>users</code> subdirectory houses both the user database and the
public/private key of a specific client.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="running-the-code">Running the Code</h2>
<p>It is imperative to configure and adjust several key
features before executing the <code>main.py</code> script:</p>
<ol>
<li>Students are expected to form groups consisting of 2-3
members and choose a <strong>username</strong>. It is requested that a
list of usernames, along with the corresponding participating
students, be sent to <a href="mailto:mohsin.khan@uit.no">mohsin.khan@uit.no</a>
or <a href="mailto:dominik.thamm@uit.no">dominik.thamm@uit.no</a>
as soon as possible. In order to avoid confusions, the username
should be identical to the institutional username (e.g. abc123).</li>
<li>The aforementioned username should then be replaced in
<code>src/server/__init__.py</code> within the <code>SELF</code> constant (e.g.
<code>SELF = 'abc123'</code>).</li>
<li>The public and private keys must b e saved in the <code>vis/users/</code> directory.</li>
<li>Verify that the <code>ADDRESS</code> is set to <code>ete011@inf3203.cs.uit.no</code>.</li>
<li>You can run the script <code>main.py</code> by running it from the <code>src/</code> directory.
You can start running the command <code>python main.py -h</code>, to check all available
commands.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="get-your-privatepublic-keys">Get your Private/Public keys</h3>
<p>In this particular blockchain implementation, verification is
carried out utilizing the <code>rsa</code> framework. It is required that
each transaction is signed using the sender's private key,
and subsequently verified using the sender's public key by the
recipient. The public/private key pair also plays a crucial
role in signing the block that has been recently mined with
the corresponding username. By doing so, once the block has
been confirmed (after a period of 6 blocks), the reward will
be granted to the user.</p>
<p>To get your public/private keys, you need to send your group
username as specified earlier to <a href="mailto:mohsin.khan@uit.no">mohsin.khan@uit.no</a>
or <a href="mailto:dominik.thamm@uit.no">dominik.thamm@uit.no</a>.
Once the private and public keys have been acquired and
saved in <code>vis/users/</code>, the candidate shall implement and read
the server's reply to <code>GET_USERS</code> call so that <code>python main.py -i u</code> returns:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

</div></code></pre>
<p>The candidate is advised to
familiarize themselves with the <code>sign</code> and <code>verification</code>
implementations that are utilized from the <code>User</code> class.</p>
<h3 id="api-endpoints">API endpoints</h3>
<p>The callable endpoints, which are located in the
<code>src/server/__init__.py</code> file, are listed below.
It is expected that the candidate will implement a
POST request using <code>BLOCK_PROPOSAL</code> for mining,
and will either generate their own transactions
(it is worth noting that a user can only generate
transactions with itself as sender) or
request them from the server pool via the <code>REQUEST_TXS</code>
endpoint. Additionally, they may employ GET requests
such as <code>GET_USERS</code>, <code>GET_BLOCKCHAIN</code>, or <code>GET_DATABASE</code>
endpoints in order to acquire network status, user data, and
blockchain-related information. <code>REQUEST_DIFFICULTY</code> is
already implemented.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>BLOCK_PROPOSAL = <span class="hljs-string">'block_proposal'</span>
GET_BLOCKCHAIN = <span class="hljs-string">'get_blockchain'</span>
GET_USERS = <span class="hljs-string">'get_users'</span>

GET_DATABASE = <span class="hljs-string">'get_database'</span>
REQUEST_DIFFICULTY = <span class="hljs-string">'request_difficulty'</span>

<p>Various endpoints can be accessed via a simple command-line
interface (CLI) menu, which is detailed below. Alternatively,
by executing the command <code>main.py -h</code>, a list of different
options will be presented. In order to avoid relative folder
paths issues, execute the code from <code>src/</code> directory.</p>

<p>By executing the command <code>main.py -v b</code>, it is possible to retrieve
the latest blockchain state in a graphical format. In case the
visualization seems unclear, one can refresh it to obtain a better
representation. This is an example of the generated pdf:

<h3 id="object-serialization">Object Serialization</h3>
<p>Embedded within each class abstraction are methods for marshaling
and unmarshaling, which facilitate the exportation of object
instances in memory to other machines. These methods are
implemented as <code>to_dict()</code> and <code>load_json()</code>. To initiate a
server request, the <code>flask_call()</code> function can be utilized.
The following are some examples:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div><span class="hljs-comment"># marshal</span>
block_serialized = block.to_dict()
msg, data, code = flask_call(<span class="hljs-string">'POST'</span>, BLOCK_PROPOSAL, data=block_serialized)
<span class="hljs-comment"># unmarshal</span>
msg, block_serialized, code = flask_call(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, BLOCK)  <span class="hljs-comment"># Just an example, not an actual call</span>
block_deserialized = Block.load_json(json.dumps(block_serialized))
</div></code></pre>
<h2 id="your-tasks">Your Tasks</h2>
<p>In order to successfully complete this assignment,
the candidate must complete both practical and theoretical
tasks. If the minimum requirements are not met, the candidate
must provide a comprehensive explanation. If the candidate
encounters difficulties with coding, they should document
their attempts and provide an explanation in their report.</p>
<h3 id="code">Code</h3>
<p>Upon downloading the code from <a href="https://github.com/ted92/bitcoin-mining-competition">here</a>, the
candidate is required to perform the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send their username to <a href="mailto:mohsin.khan@uit.no">mohsin.khan@uit.no</a>
or <a href="mailto:dominik.thamm@uit.no">dominik.thamm@uit.no</a>
to obtain the public and private keys.</li>
<li>Familiarize themselves with the code and interact
with the server by implementing and managing basic
client-side responses with API calls of <code>GET_BLOCKCHAIN</code>
and <code>GET_USERS</code>. Commands <code>python main.py -i [b, u]</code>;</li>
<li>Learn about Proof of Work and Merkle trees (useful
for the report) so to handle and understand the
<code>REQUEST_TXS</code> calls for mining new blocks. Command <code>python main.py -t</code>;</li>
<li>Implement <strong>Merkle tree</strong> structure in <code>src/backbone/merkle.py</code>;</li>
<li>Implement the consensus mechanism <strong>Proof of Work</strong>
in <code>src/backbone/consensus.py</code>. Command <code>python main.py -m</code>;</li>
<li>Propose a criterion or algorithm for the selection of
parent and mining of blocks that minimizes the likelihood
of orphaning or inclusion in the less successful branch of the blockchain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the <code>hash_function()</code> is used for verification server-side in
the Merkle tree, while <code>double_hash()</code> is used for Proof of Work.
Both functions can be found in <code>src/utils/cryptographic.py</code>, and the order
for double hashing a block header is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>previous block hash</li>
<li>time</li>
<li>Merkle root</li>
<li>nonce</li>
</ol>
<p>The starting <strong>difficulty is set at 6</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="report">Report</h3>
<p>The report must present a comprehensive description of the approach
employed by the candidate to solve the given problem. It should
include a detailed explanation of their Proof of Work algorithm,
demonstrating their understanding of how this consensus mechanism
operates. If the candidate encountered any issues in their attempts
to mine a block, these should be documented thoroughly in the report.
For the report, the candidate should use the
<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-template/grfzhhncsfqn">IEEE conference template</a>,
and the report must not be less than 5 pages long. The report should
cover the following topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction to <strong>public</strong> and <strong>private</strong> blockchains,
highlighting the main differences, advantages, and disadvantages of each.</li>
<li>A detailed explanation of the concept of mining in Proof of Work blockchain
networks, including how miners compete to add new blocks to the blockchain
and the role that difficulty plays in this process. From this, the candidate
should discuss their approach to solving the Code task of this assignment.</li>
<li>A comparative analysis of the main strengths and weaknesses of the Proof
of Work consensus mechanism. The candidate should also compare and contrast
this mechanism with other consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of
Stake [2-4], Byzantine FT [5], or Proof of Storage [6].</li>
<li>An analysis of the environmental impact of Proof of Work blockchain
networks. The candidate should identify the key criticisms of Proof of
Work from an environmental perspective and discuss potential solutions
to address these concerns.</li>
<li>A discussion of the potential security threats to Proof of Work
blockchain networks. The candidate should highlight the most
significant security risks and provide recommendations for mitigating them.</li>
<li>A consideration of the scalability limitations of Proof of Work
blockchain networks. The candidate should identify the key factors
that affect scalability and explore potential solutions to address
these limitations.</li>
</ol>
